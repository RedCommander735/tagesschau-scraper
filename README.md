# Tagesschau-Scraper

This is an attempt to build a scraper for the Tagesschau website, and return news in a similar fashion to the already existing [Tageschau API](https://tagesschau.api.bund.dev/). This is, because the API is always a few hour behind and because some [other project](https://github.com/RedCommander735/topotest) of mine is dependat on said API and I'd like to change that.  
Feel free to contribute to this by creating a pull request and I will look it through.
